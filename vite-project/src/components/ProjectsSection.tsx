If a blob is found, it recursively counts all connected blobs in that area, otherwise, it returns 0.

        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">- <strong>BMI Calculator App:</strong><br>
        An Android application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. This project helped me learn Android development with Java, including UI components and event handling.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">- <strong>Java Control Structures Practice:</strong><br>
        A set of utility methods to practice Java control structures, including loops, conditionals, and method creation. This project reinforced my understanding of algorithms and handling edge cases.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">- <strong>Vending Machine Simulation:</strong><br>
        A simulation of a vending machine that manages stock levels and user interactions. Through this project, I learned about class-based structures, state management, and method design.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">- <strong>Course Registration System:</strong><br>
        A system that models student course registrations, tracks grades, and generates GPA reports. This project involved designing object-oriented models and managing associations between objects.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">- <strong>Utilities for Array Manipulation:</strong><br>
        Utility methods for advanced array operations, such as finding multiples of 3 and flattening 2D arrays. This project enhanced my skills in array manipulation and debugging.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">- <strong>Auto Shop Management System:</strong><br>
        A management system for an auto shop, handling operations like adding, selling, and transferring ownership of vehicles. This project taught me about working with collections in Java and enforcing business rules through exception handling.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">Each project includes a JUnit test file to ensure the correctness of the implemented logic, solidifying my understanding of unit testing in Java.</p>
